1. Make sure build-essential is updated
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential zlib1g-dev \
    libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev \
    libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev curl -y

2. Download the source release for the version to install - https://www.python.org/downloads/

3. Unzip it in a directory
tar -xf downloaded-file-name.tar.xz

4. Go to the unziped directory
./configure --prefix=location
The location is where you want the python version installed", example, ~/Development/python3/python3.12

It is possible to add "--enable-optimizations" flag. It claims to improve the compiled python performance by 10%
and it takes a longer time, and may not succeed in some environment, in my use case, I just skipped it

make
make install

5.Add symlink
In Ubuntu, the ~/bin is automatically added to the PATH if available
ln -sf "absolute path to python in the local install" ~/bin/python3.12 (If installing python3.12)

6. Check if install was successful
which python3.12
python3.12 -m venv .env-3.12

The venv is available to the installation from source by default
