1. Add ppa
In most systems, it is simply a command
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
sudo apt update

2. Then install
apt policy python3.12

3. venv is installed as a different package
apt policy python3.12-venv


* It is possible to remove a ppa - https://askubuntu.com/questions/307/how-can-ppas-be-removed
sudo add-apt-repository --remove ppa:deadsnakes/ppa


4. If not possible to use add-apt-repository, the repository can be manually added
* ppa are added to "/etc/apt/sources.list.d" as a file
ls -l /etc/apt/sources.list.d
cat /etc/apt/sources.list.d/deadsnakes-ubuntu-ppa-jammy.list

for example, deadsnakes is added to "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/deadsnakes-ubuntu-ppa-jammy.list" file
the gpg (https://www.gnupg.org/) file is placed in "/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/deadsnakes-ubuntu-ppa.gpg"

download gpg help - https://askubuntu.com/questions/1312464/how-to-get-the-gpg-key-for-a-repository
CURL - curl -S "https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x<fingerprint>" >key.asc,
    where (fingerprint is found in PPA page)
dearmor the asc file => "gpg --dearmor key.asc -o filename.gpg" and put into the "/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d" directory,
The name of the gpg file needs to follow the patten
