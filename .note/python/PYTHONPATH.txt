Python adds the directory where the initial script resides as first item to sys.path:

- As initialized upon program startup, the first item of this list, path[0]
- It is "the directory containing the script" (Not necessarily the current directory) that was used to invoke the Python interpreter
- If the script directory is not available (e.g. if the interpreter is invoked interactively or if the script is read from standard input),
    path[0] is the empty string, which directs Python to search modules in the current directory first
- Notice that the script directory is inserted before the entries inserted as a result of PYTHONPATH.

------------------------------------
Put the following in the ~/.profile file
# Always add "." (the path of the place where the python command is issued) to PYTHONPATH
export PYTHONPATH=":$PYTHONPATH"
