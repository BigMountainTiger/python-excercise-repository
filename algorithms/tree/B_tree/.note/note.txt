* B-tree is good when we are unable to load all the data into memory
* Need to load data from the slower storage

Note => m = 2 * t, t is called minium degree
-----------------------------------------
1. Every node has at most 2*t children (2*t - 1 keys)
2. Every node, except for the root and the leaves, has at least t children (t - 1 keys)
3. A non-leaf node with k children contains kâˆ’1 keys
4. The root node has at least two children unless it is a leaf
