Insert key
-----------------------------------------
A key is always inserted into a leaf
    - A key is always inserted into a leaf node
    - The keys in a node is sorted
    - It is convinent to compare the new key with the existing key list backward (from larger to smaller) to find the index for the new key

Split node
-----------------------------------------
1. When inserting a key, if a node is full (n = 2*t -1) keys, it is splited, even though it is not a leaf
2. When spliting a node
    - Each child will have t - 1 keys
    - Each child will have t children, if the splited node is not a leaf
    - The middle key (2*t - 1) = (2*(t - 1) + 1) and the new child will be added into the parent
