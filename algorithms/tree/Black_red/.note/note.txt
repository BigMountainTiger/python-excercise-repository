Rules:
------------------------------------
1. Every node is either RED or BLACK
2. Root is always BLACK
3. New insertions are always RED
4. Every path from root-leaf has the same number of BLACK nodes
5. No path can have two consecutive RED nodes (consecutive BLACK nodes are OK)
6. Nulls are BLACK

- A red black tree is less balanced than an AVL tree, but it needs fewer rotations when nodes are inserted and deleted
- This makes it ideal when there are a lot of insert an deletion operations
- while AVL tree is more suitable for read-heavy situations
