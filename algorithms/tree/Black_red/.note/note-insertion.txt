Insertion:
Double RED is the violation

- New node is always RED, when a new node is added to a RED node, we have a double RED situation
- When double RED, we need to fix the color

1. If 2 consecutive RED nodes and the aunt is RED -> flip the color
    - Set the top node to RED
    - Set the two childen of the top node to BLACK

2. If 2 consecutive RED nodes and the aunt is BLACK -> rotate + fix color
    - If the connected RED nodes is 'll' -> right rotate
    - If the connected RED nodes is 'rr' -> left rotate
    - If the connected RED nodes is 'lr' -> left rotate + right rotate
    - If the connected RED nodes is 'rl' -> right rotate + left rotate
    * After the rotation fix color
        - Set the new top node to BLACK
        - Set the two childen of the new top node RED (1 of them should be already RED)

3. We need to recursively check for double RED and fix it if encountered until the root

4. Always set the root as BLACK
