For auto-complete:

settings.json file
---------------------------------------------------------

It looks like this is taking effect
"python.analysis.extraPaths": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/vs_code_python_env-def-file/libs"
]

Reading the documentation, could not understand what this does
It seems that it can be removed from the settings.json file
"python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/vs_code_python_env-def-file/libs"
]
