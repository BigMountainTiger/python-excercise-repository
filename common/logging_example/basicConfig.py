# The logging.basicConfig() function in Python's logging module provides
# a straightforward way to configure basic logging functionality.
# It is designed for quick setup and is suitable for simple logging needs.

# Basic Usage
# Calling logging.basicConfig() without arguments configures the logging system with a default StreamHandler
# that outputs log messages to the console.

# The default log level is WARNING,
# meaning that only messages with a severity of WARNING or higher (e.g., ERROR, CRITICAL) will be displayed.

# Important Considerations
# basicConfig() should ideally be called only once in a program
# Subsequent calls will be ignored unless the force argument is set to True

# If any logging calls (e.g., logging.info(), logging.debug()) are made before basicConfig() is called,
# the logging module configures itself automatically with default settings.
# This can prevent later calls to basicConfig() from having any effect.

# For more complex logging configurations, consider using logging.config.fileConfig() or logging.config.dictConfig()
