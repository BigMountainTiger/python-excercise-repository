javascript allows await a non-async function
python does not allows await a non-async function, it is a run-time error

In javascript, when encountering an await, it will run into the awaited function recursively for any synchronous code until the last await.
In python, the awaited function (coroutine object) is put into the event loop as a whole
    (calling the coroutine function returns a coroutine object without running the code at all)
