# The nonlocal keyword in Python is used within nested functions to declare
# that a variable refers to a previously bound variable in the "NEAREST" enclosing non-global scope. 

# This allows inner functions to modify variables defined in their enclosing function's scopes. 


# "NEAREST" is not necessarily the immediate outer scope
