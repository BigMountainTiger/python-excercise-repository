Key words:
    1. module/package/__init__.py
    2. sys.path
    3. sys.modules

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A module is just a .py file
    1. Importing a module is assigning the module object to a variable.
       If the variable is re-assigned, the module object is no longer accessible from the variable
    2. A module does not have to be in a package
    2. A package is a special module that is a folder
       - When loaded the __file__ property is the __init__.py file in the folder. if no __init__.py, the __file__ is None
         the name of the pachage is the full path of the folder counting from the sys.path
       - Becuse it is a folder, it can contain other modules
       - Packages can be nested

2. A package is a folder that contains the modules
    - A package is a special module by itself
    - When loaded the __file__ property is the __init__.py file in the folder. If no __init__.py (optional starting python3.3+), the __file__ is None
    - The name of the pachage is the full path of the folder counting from the sys.path
    - Nested packages can each has it own __init__.py
      When a module or sub-package is imported directly, all the __init__.py files of its parent package tree are loaded in the order from the top to the leaf

3. The sys.path object contains the list of the folders that the python interpreter looking for packages and modules
    1. The directory containing the top-level script (python top_level_script.py) is automatically added to the sys.path
    2. The PYTHONPATH environment variable (: separated linux, ; separated in windows list of folders) add in the front of the default sys.path
    3. It may a good idea to use absolute path in PYTHONPATH as the working directory may change
    4. We can manipulate the sys.path object in the python code, but it is generally not recommended

4. The sys.modules obect keep all the modules already loaded
    1. The sys.modules is a directory, key is the full name of the module, the value contains the absolute path to the corresponding .py file
    2. If a package is imported, the "__file__" property is the __init__.py file in the package. If no __init__.py file (namespace package), it is None
    3. When importing a module, python looks for sys.modules. If exists, it will just use it.
       If not, it looks for the module by the order specified in the sys.path. If the folders in the sys.path are mutual exclusive, the same module will
       be loaded only once
    4. The __init__.py file in a package is a module by itself, the name of the module is the name of the package. When importing a pachage,
       the __init__.py is imported. Even when a module is imported directly, the package containing the module (the __init__.py file) is still imported
    5. Within a package, if importing modules in the same package, dot path (. or .. or ...) can be used
    6. dot "." importing beyong the top-level package is a run-time error (because the path will be beyond the sys.path)
