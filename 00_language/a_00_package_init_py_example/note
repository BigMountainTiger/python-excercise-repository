It is tested that the __init__.py file is no longer required in higher version of python

1. The minimal unit of python import is a module - a ".py" file (Execute the file)
2. Once imported, the full name is of module is "Package-name/directory-path-to-module/module-name" and can be accessed such way
3. The as syntax can give a short name of the module
4. In a package, the "__init__.py" is automatically executed, so anything imported in it no longer need to explicitly imported.
