1. patch takes a string to the path of the item

The patch target should be a string in the form 'package.module.ClassName'.
The target is imported and the specified object replaced with the new object,
so the target must be importable from the environment you are calling patch() from.
The target is imported when the decorated function is executed,
not at decoration time

The path string "package.module.function" is the path accessible from where it is used

2. patch_object takes an actual object
